                <p>
                    Hello there! My name is Suchith and I'm a Developer (I enjoy
                    building stuff on the web and otherwise :)). I am currently
                    pursuing my undergraduate degree in computer science at the
                    Dalhousie University, Canada.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a Full-Stack programmer who also specializes in GUI and
                    CLI (Command-line interface) based application programming
                    for Windows and Linux. I am passionate about computers and
                    servers and intrigued about operating systems and their
                    workings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My specialties include setting up an environment for hosting
                    a web app including coding both frontend and backend while
                    simultaneously setting up a Linux server for hosting the
                    app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What started out as an obsession to learn everything (I know
                    it's not possible!!) ended up becoming one of my biggest
                    skill. I am now an intentional & passionate learner who
                    learns almost anything quickly and effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My hobbies include (Not that anyone asked, but hey this is
                    my website!) studying Astrophysics, Philosophy, Economics,
                    Psychology, Theoretical Physics, and the rest of the
                    sciences (fill in the blanks!).
